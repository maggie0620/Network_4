# Network_4
Use network 1 and treat it as directed 
### 1. Calculate its density 

### 2. Output its adjacency and incidence matrix 

### 3. Find its transitive closure
Propose the algorithms with pseudocode doing:

(1) Run BFS with adjacency matrix structure

(2) Run DFS with adjacency list structure

* Hint: BFS in favored with adjacency list structure ; DFS is favored with adjacency matrix structure
